(!) This documentation is contains many things that are not currently available in the App Store app (!)

I'm so sorry for the bugs of the app, but the App Store is taking soooooo many time to review the app. I sent numerous emails but the app still without being reviewed.

# Pyto

Pyto is a native Python IDE for iOS that uses the Python C API.

Note that this documentation is always updated with the source code. So this documentation is not always valid for the App Store app even if you have the latest version.

# API

Pyto has some modules that allows your scripts to interact with the app.

- [console](Console)
- [mainthread](MainThread)
- [pasteboard](Pasteboard)
- [sharing](Sharing)

You can use `os.system` to run some basic GNU commands.

# Third party packges

If you want to import modules or packages you have locally, put the sources on the app's Documents directory.
