Pyto has some modules that allows your scripts to interact with the app.

- [console](Console)
- [mainthread](MainThread)

You can use `os.system` to run some basic GNU commands.

If you want to import modules or packages you have locally, put the sources on the `modules` directory.

The module [rubicon.objc](https://www.github.com/pybee/rubicon-objc) is included in the app.
